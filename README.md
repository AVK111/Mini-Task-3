"# Mini-Task-3"
About Dataset - The dataset contains observational records of crocodiles, including their common name, scientific name, family, observed length (in meters), and observed weight (in kilograms). It provides both categorical information (species, family) and numerical measurements (length and weight), making it suitable for analyzing species distribution, size variation, and correlations between physical attributes.
Insights from Visualizations
Species Distribution: Some crocodile species are observed far more frequently than others (visible in bar plots).
Length & Weight: There is a strong positive correlation (~0.84) between observed length and weight â€” longer crocodiles tend to weigh more.
Outliers: Both length and weight show outliers, suggesting unusually large or small observations compared to the majority.
Variation Across Species: Boxplots and violin plots highlight size variation across different species/families.
Data Spread: KDE plots show the weight distribution is right-skewed, meaning most crocodiles weigh less, but a few very heavy ones pull the average up.
